This is a simple tool for reading data from Pedalog devices. It relies on the libpedalog library to do the actual
communication with the device: https://github.com/greenlynx/libpedalog

The Pedalog is a device made by Renewable Energy Innovations (http://www.re-innovation.co.uk).
It has been specially designed to monitor the power and energy generated by pedal powered electricity generators.

This program is licensed under the GPLv3 and has been tested on Linux and Windows. It is designed
to work cross-platform but has not yet been tested on other systems.

Usage: pedalog-tool

If a Pedalog is connected, its current values will be displayed. On Linux, this usually needs to be run as root to
allow access to the device.
